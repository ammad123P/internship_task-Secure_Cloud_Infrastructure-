# ðŸš€ Secure Cloud Infrastructure Audit

## ðŸ“Œ Objective
Ensure cloud-based platforms follow industry-standard security measures by auditing, securing, and monitoring **AWS resources**.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Key Tasks Performed

### âœ… 1. Audit Cloud Accounts (IAM)
- Reviewed IAM users, groups, and roles.  
- Verified permissions using **IAM Policy Simulator**.  
- Captured audit evidence of **least privilege enforcement**.

---

### âœ… 2. Set Up Multi-Region Backups (S3)
- Created **S3 buckets** in multiple regions for redundancy.  
- Enabled **bucket encryption (AES-256/KMS)**.  
- Enabled **bucket versioning** for recovery.

---

### âœ… 3. Enable Web Application Firewall (WAF)
- Configured **AWS WAF** to filter malicious traffic.  
- Created rules to block common threats (SQLi, XSS, bad IPs).  
- Monitored incoming requests for suspicious activity.

### âœ… 4. Security Group Audit (EC2)
- Reviewed inbound/outbound rules for:  
  - **Web Server SG** â†’ HTTP/HTTPS restricted to internal IPs.  
  - **Bastion Host SG** â†’ SSH/RDP allowed only from management network.  
  - **SQL Server SG** â†’ Database access restricted to web server only.

### âœ… 5. VPC and Network ACL Audit
- Verified **VPC configuration** and subnets.  
- Reviewed **Network ACL inbound/outbound rules**.  
- Ensured segmentation & isolation of resources.

### âœ… 6. CloudWatch Monitoring
- Reviewed **EC2 performance metrics** (CPU, I/O).  
- Checked **EBS volume monitoring**.  
- Confirmed **CloudWatch alarms** for system health.

---

### âœ… 7. CloudTrail Logs Audit
- Verified **CloudTrail trails** storing logs in S3.  
- Reviewed **event history** in JSON format.  
- Ensured **traceability** of all account activities.  
ðŸ“· *Screenshot:* `screenshots/cloudtrail_logs.png`

## ðŸ”¹ Data Sources
- **AWS CloudTrail logs**  
- **AWS CloudWatch metrics**  
- **VPC & Security Group configurations**  
- **S3 bucket settings**  
- Public datasets from **AWS Open Data**

## ðŸ”¹ Conclusion
This project demonstrates how to:
- âœ… Audit cloud accounts for compliance.  
- âœ… Secure storage with **multi-region backups & encryption**.  
- âœ… Protect workloads using **Web Application Firewall (WAF)**.  
- âœ… Monitor activity via **CloudWatch & CloudTrail**.  
- âœ… Enforce **least privilege & network segmentation**.  

ðŸ“Œ **Result:** A secure and resilient **cloud infrastructure** aligned with best practices.
